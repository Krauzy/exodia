## Exploits

 - Perform **SQL Injection** attempts on websites based on parameters

### SQL Injection

 | Type                  | Description                                                                                                                                                           	|
|-----------------------	|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Classic SQL Injection 	| This attack takes advantage of improper handling of user input in database queries <br/> allowing the attacker to alter the behavior of the SQL query to their advantage.|
| Boolean-based Blind   	| Is a type of SQL Injection where an attacker sends SQL queries that return a true or false<br/> result based on the behavior of the database, without actually seeing the data.|
| Time-based Blind      	| An attacker determines whether a query returns TRUE or FALSE by controlling the time delay in the database's response.|
| Union-based           	| Is a technique that exploits SQL's UNION operator to combine the results of two or more SELECT queries into a single result set.|
| Error-based           	| Is a technique where an attacker deliberately triggers database errors to retrieve information from the error messages.|
